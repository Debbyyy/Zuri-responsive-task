# Zuri-responsive-task
this is a task that tested our knowledge of media queries. there may be some inconsistencies but bear in mind that i am a beginner.

hello world!
greetings!
it's me again, a trainee on the #I4GxZuri training
this is our first task with express instructions to make the site responsive.
the HTML and CSS was done by one of the mentors @emmypuch. i just did the media queries
feedback is appreciated.
bye world!
